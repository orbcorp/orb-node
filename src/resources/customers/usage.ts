  /**
   * This endpoint is used to amend usage within a timeframe for a customer that has
   * an active subscription.
   *
   * This endpoint will mark _all_ existing events within
   * `[timeframe_start, timeframe_end)` as _ignored_ for billing purposes, and Orb
   * will only use the _new_ events passed in the body of this request as the source
   * of truth for that timeframe moving forwards. Note that a given time period can
   * be amended any number of times, so events can be overwritten in subsequent calls
   * to th is endpoint.
   *
   * This is a powerful and audit-safe mechanism to retroactively change usage data
   * in cases where you need to:
   *
   * - decrease historical usage consumption because of degraded service availability
   *   in your systems
   * - account for gaps from your usage reporting mechanism
   * - make point-in-time fixes for specific event records, while retaining the
   *   original time of usage and associated metadata. This amendment API is designed
   *   with two explicit goals:
   *
   * 1. Amendments are **always audit-safe**. The amendment process will still retain
   *    original events in the timeframe, though they will be ignored for billing
   *    calculations. For auditing a nd data fidelity purposes, Orb never overwrites
   *    or permanently deletes ingested usage data.
   * 2. Amendments always preserve data **consistency**. In other words, either an
   *    amendment is fully processed by the system (and the new events for the
   *    timeframe are honored rather than the existing ones) or the amendment request
   *    fails. To maintain this important property, Orb prevents _partial event
   *    ingestion_ on this endpoint.
   *
   * ## Response semantics
   *
   * - Either all events are ingested successfully, or all fail to ingest (returning
   *   a `4xx` or `5xx` response code).
   * - Any event that fails schema validation will lead to a `4xx` response. In this
   *   case, to maintain data consistency, Orb will not ingest any events and will
   *   also not deprecate existing events in the time period.
   * - You can assume that the amendment is successful on receipt of a `2xx`
   *   response.While a successful response from this endpoint indicates that the new
   *   events have been ingested, updating usage totals happens asynchronously and
   *   may be delayed by a few minutes.
   *
   * As emphasized above, Orb will never show an inconsistent state (e.g. in invoice
   * previews or dashboards); either it will show the existing state (before the
   * amendment) or the new state (with new events in the requested timeframe).
   *
   * ## Sample request body
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "events": [
   *     {
   *       "event_name": "payment_processed",
   *       "timestamp": "2022-03-24T07:15:00Z",
   *       "properties": {
   *         "amount": 100
   *       }
   *     },
   *     {
   *       "event_name": "payment_failed",
   *       "timestamp": "2022-03-24T07:15:00Z",
   *       "properties": {
   *         "amount": 100
   *       }
   *     }
   *   ]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ## Request Validation
   *
   * - The `timestamp` of each event reported must fall within the bounds of
   *   `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end`. As with ingestion, all timesta mps must
   *   be sent in ISO8601 format with UTC timezone offset.
   * - Orb **does not accept an `idempotency_key`** with each event in this endpoint,
   *   since the entirety of the event list must be ingested to ensure consistency.
   *   On retryable errors , you should retry the request in its entirety, and assume
   *   that the amendment operation has not succeeded until receipt of a `2xx`.
   *
   * - Both `timeframe_start` and `timeframe_end` must be timestamps in the past.
   *   Furthermore, Orb will genera lly validate that the `timeframe_start` and
   *   `timeframe_end` fall within the customer's _current_ subscription billing pe
   *   riod. However, Orb does allow amendments while in the grace period of the
   *   previous billing period; in this instance, the timeframe can start before the
   *   current period.
   *
   * ## API Limits
   *
   * Note that Orb does not currently enforce a hard rate- limit for API usage or a
   * maximum request payload size. Similar to the event ingestion API, this API is
   * architected for h igh-throughput ingestion. It is also safe to
   * _programmatically_ call this endpoint if your system can automatically dete ct a
   * need for historical amendment.
   *
   * In order to overwrite timeframes with a very large number of events, we suggest
   * using multiple calls with small adjacent (e.g. every hour) timeframes.

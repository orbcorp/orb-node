/**
 * A coupon represents a reusable discount configuration that can be applied either
 * as a fixed or percentage amount to an invoice or subscription. Coupons are
 * activated using a redemption code, which applies the discount to a subscription
 * or invoice. The duration of a coupon determines how long it remains available
 * for use by end users.
 *
 * ## How to use coupons
 *
 * Coupons can be created using the Orb dashboard or programmatically through the
 * API. Once a coupon is created, it can be managed and applied programmatically
 * via the API. To redeem a coupon, use the `redemption_code` property when
 * [creating a subscription](create-subscription.api.mdx) or when scheduling a
 * [plan change](schedule-plan-change.api.mdx).
 *
 * ## When to use coupons
 *
 * A common use case for coupons is through self-serve signup or upgrade flows in
 * your checkout experience or billing portal. Coupons can also be used as one-off
 * to incentivize use for custom agreements.
 *
 * Coupons are effective when launching new features and encouraging existing users
 * to upgrade to a higher tier. For example, you could create a coupon code
 * "UPGRADE20" that offers a 20% discount on the first month of the new plan. This
 * code can be applied during the upgrade process in your billing portal, making it
 * straightforward for users to benefit from the new features at a reduced cost.
 *
 * ## Coupon scoping
 *
 * When a coupon is applied on a subscription, it creates a discount adjustment
 * that applies to all of the prices on the subscription at the time of the coupon
 * application. Notably, coupons do not scope in new price additions to a
 * subscription automatically â€” if a new price is added to the subscription with a
 * subscription edit or plan version migration, the discount created with the
 * coupon will not apply to it automatically. If you'd like the coupon to apply to
 * newly added prices, you can
 * [edit the adjustment intervals](add-edit-price-intervals.api.mdx) to end the
 * discount interval created by the coupon at the time of the migration and add a
 * new one starting at the time of the migration that includes the newly added
 * prices you'd like the coupon to apply to.
